# Act III - NumbSkill Island - Adventure, Glory & Loot*

## Scene 0 - 

> [!TIP]
> All the masked figures in the smoke-filled (side) bar were silent. Finally a shadowy figure wearing a sombrero cordobés rasped ... "¿Maestro, are you sure? Is there no other way?".
>
> An aged whisper drifted back from the darkness shrouded mirror. "Our time has ... passed, too many of my colleagues and compatriots have already returned to the land of shaDOW to fight the good fight against fear, igorance and greed. I can only preserve a small part of the lore, entrusted to your care, to foster the next cadre. Think of it as ... a proving ground, many may stumble, some surrender to temptation, even shredded by their inner demons. But we are not _scared scribes_ pouring over dusty tombs of caselaw. We are not LLM tinkerers, amusing ourselves with shiny toys. We are **rogues**, we follow the golden corollary and will carve our way through history."
>
> A sharp intake ... "So be it ... unleash the LEETHs, muster the mentors, and may God have mercy on the weak".

<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263462610_Experiential_learning_Inspiring_the_business_leaders_of_tomorrow">Experiental learning</a> is to exposure members of LexDAO to a specific culture fut suitable for entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation. 80% of trained lawyers are officers of the court, with compliance and risk mitigation their proper purpose. Another 9% might end up in judiciary or regulatory enforcement in ajudication or rule-making (also the role of subject matter experts in ADR). But the last 1% is the school of hard knocks, where you push acceptance of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/policyandsociety/article/41/3/358/6529327">alegal</a> artifacts/mechanism to solve specific socio-tokenonomic systems. The mindset for this 1% is difficult, you don't necessarily need pure analytical capability (though helps in go-to-market strategies) but <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264573570_The_moral_legitimacy_of_entrepreneurs_An_analysis_of_early-stage_entrepreneurship_across_26_countries">inner conviction</a> that can sustain through early trials and tribulations.

The 54-hour hackathon is a deliberate stress-test of working with unfamiliar team-mates in fixed time with defined output. The subject matter is deliberately choosen to be tractable for non-rogues (evidence gathering) up to argumentative reasoning (generic but debating skills help). Expecting heterogenous grrous we scale the difficulty in 3 dimensions 
- scope ... designed so 1-2 people insufficient in the time-frame, they have to split the RfQ into smaller sub-tasks;
- handicap ... the weaker teams are given more LXCHAT as compensation for "consulting" time of mentors;
- cheat-sheets ... some sock-puppets (fake discordIDs kept for anon participants) to drop in useful links or samples when hopelessly off-track

We know many W4M participants are skilled in law (not necessarily IP). The goal is to force them (with with the foxhole buddy of peer pressure) to acquire skills not native to their prior class. For non-rogues, this would be `argument map` a formal way (Scribe 2+) to reason about supporting evidence for a point of view. For rogues, it would be getting exposure to hackMD and indirectly github which are key to multi-party largescale collaboration. Because it is mock-play, there is scope to experiment and make (non-fatal) mistakes as this is an administrative appeal, not high-stake court case.
